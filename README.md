# CPET-ion-slowing-simulation
This code simulates the slowing of ions confined in a cooler Penning trap. The ion slowing inside a 
co-confined non-neutral plasma is simulated using a stochastic-PDE formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation. 
The impact of rest gas on the ion motion is accounted for by modelling ion-neutral collisions in a 
semiclassical model.
